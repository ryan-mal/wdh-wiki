![Laplace Klei.png](/img/user/z_Assets/PCs/Laplace%20Klei.png)
Laplace Rosznar was born into the affluent and notorious [[5-World Almanac/Noble Families/House Rosznar\|House Rosznar]] in Waterdeep on Ches 19, 1476. As the second child and first-born son of [[Rolteme Rosznar\|Rolteme Rosznar]] and [[Azalea Rosznar\|Azalea Rosznar]], Laplace grew up overshadowed by his elder sister, [[z_Assets/NPCs/Esvele Rosznar\|Esvele Rosznar]], who was revered as the perfect heir - yet Laplace still adored her in every way. Despite the familial pressures, Laplace's early years were relatively carefree, mainly spent within the safe confines of their grand estate, under the doting eye of Esvele.

The Rosznar family, however, faced significant prejudice due to their dubious reputation, which eventually led to their exile from Waterdeep. Seeking refuge, they returned to their core family's vineyards in Amn, where they were received with disdain. This transition marked a turning point for Laplace, as the protective presence of his sister was abruptly withdrawn when she ran away from home on his tenth birthday, leaving him a pocket watch inscribed with a promise of connection.

Feeling the weight of his family's expectations and the absence of his sister, Laplace struggled to adapt. By the age of fourteen, burdened by his family's declining fortunes and societal disdain, he stowed away in a wine barrel and fled north, discarding his Rosznar identity for a new moniker, Laplace Klei. His na√Øve understanding of money quickly led him to destitution, driving him to seek solace in the perceived selflessness of a monastery.

Laplace joined the [[Sammasamutaito Monastery\|Sammasamutaito Monastery]], hoping to find genuine kindness and support. He grew close to Master [[Hakim\|Hakim]], finding in him a semblance of the familial bond he had lost. However, his trust was shattered when he was manipulated into administering what he believed was a life-saving cure to a young girl, [[Marie Aderbrant\|Marie Aderbrant]]. The potion turned out to be lethal, resulting in Marie's death and implicating the monastery in a dark plot.

The monastery was destroyed, and Laplace was captured by the [[5-World Almanac/a_Allied Factions/Harpers\|Harpers]], who initially accused him of murder. After intense interrogation, the Harpers, led by [[Mirt\|Mirt]], recognized Laplace's innocence and released him, suggesting he seek a new beginning, with a suggestion that he might find purpose in the Yawning Portal

Laplace, having endured exploitation and betrayal, learned to rely on his understanding of wealth and intentions over simple trust. His experiences taught him that money, while not his pursuit, was a tool for discerning truth and guarding against deceit.
