Born in Waterdeep to the noble [[House Darkvein\|House Darkvein]], he was fortunate enough to spend most of his childhood in a mansion on the outskirts of [[Carran\|Carran]], in the Ardeep Forest. Although his parents, [[Brulam Darkvein\|Brulam Darkvein]] and [[Sadie Darkvein\|Sadie Darkvein]], were often distant—his father buried in his technological research and his mother engrossed in her garden—he never felt lonely. He frequently visited the nearby village of Carran, where he befriended two Satyrs, [[Cernunn\|Cernunn]] and his younger sister [[Artia\|Artia]], an Aasimar around his age who ran a farm in town.

His parents were co-founders of the Waterdeep faction of the [[5-World Almanac/a_Allied Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]] and had moved to Ardeep Forest to serve as diplomats between Waterdeep and Carran. Unbeknownst to him, they also had a secret mission to protect a rare devil ritual component known as the [[Serpent's Coil\|Serpent's Coil]].

One morning, he awoke to a loud ruckus and discovered his parents frantically searching for and destroying various components and documents. Noticing scratch marks outside the window, his mother quickly hugged him tightly, gave him a strange cloak, and instructed him to run to Mayor [[Rathal Cyne\|Rathal Cyne]]'s house in Carran without looking back. As he escaped, he heard sounds like the door being kicked down and saw red eyes looming in the darkness.

As he made it to Carran, he spent the night in Rathal's basement. The next morning, he learned that a group of Devils, attracted by Artia's angelic presence, had invaded Carran. He recognized the red eyes of one of the dead creatures that Cernunn had killed.

Returning to the manor, he found it wrecked and his parents missing. A led attack was made on the house. This allowed him access to the secret books in his parents' study, which spoke of devils and dark figures. Outside, he encountered a Druidic woman by his father's favorite tree. She revealed she was a Dryad, bound to the tree but unnamed. He named her [[Divona\|Divona]], after a guardian from a book he read as a child.

Divona became his new caretaker, magically maintaining the house to prevent it from deteriorating, although it appeared overgrown from the outside. When he grew extremely weak with illness, Divona created special bandages from her own energy to keep him alive.

Over the years, he read all the books in the house multiple times, becoming an expert in arcane knowledge, spirits, and emulating his father's creations. One day, Artia visited, worried about her brother Cernunn, who had gone to Waterdeep to confront the Devils. Divona cast a spell revealing Cernunn was in grave danger. Before he set out to save him, Divona revealed a secret basement filled with Serpent's Coils, the infernal flowers his parents had been protecting. Armed with this knowledge, he began his journey to Waterdeep.
