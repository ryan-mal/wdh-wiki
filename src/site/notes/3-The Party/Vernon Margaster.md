Gripping his ticking pocket-watch in a blood-soaked fist, he braced for another blow when a commanding voice echoed through the mess hall. *"FARRIS... that's enough,"* it thundered, a voice both feminine and forceful. As his father, [[Farris Margaster\|Farris Margaster]] lowered his bruised knuckles, a sense of relief washed over Vernon—not from the cessation of pain, but from the realization that his mother, [[Ember Margaster\|Ember Margaster]] had finally returned. Her arrival meant not just a reprieve but a potential escape from the torment he had endured.

*"I will make sure he pays his price,"* she exclaimed, grabbing him firmly by the arm and guiding him hastily out of the mess hall. A sour but agreeing grunt was heard from his father as they exited the blood-stained room.

*"I've made the preparations,"* his mother whispered in a hushed tone, *"follow [[Fidi\|Fidi]], and he'll bring you to your new home."* 
*"I'll come back for you, Mother. I will never forget what you've done for me,"* he let out, almost choking on the stream of tears covering his face. Little did he know, at that moment, the hug his mother gave him would be the final loving embrace he'd ever share with her.

Hurrying to his bedroom, he found his lifelong best friend: a small yellow canary, perched on his wide-open windowsill. Approaching him, he heard the familiar chirpy voice ring out in his head, *"We run, we avoid bad men."* 
*"I'll follow your lead, Fidi!"* he replied. Fidi led him through the window, and he had to run faster than he ever thought he could to escape his father's guards, who quickly caught wind of their plan. Losing them in the [[City of the Dead\|City of the Dead]], he and Fidi made their way through the trees to a glistening blue spring—which deceptively, was a portal to the home of his new family: [[5-World Almanac/a_Allied Factions/Emerald Enclave\|Emerald Enclave]]. Diving into the sparkling liquid signaled the beginning of his new life, working towards the betterment of himself and, more importantly, the natural world.

In the following months, he learned to hone his unusual innate ability to "speak" to Fidi (and, as he discovered, to speak to almost any beast of the wild) and learned that these abilities encompassed far more than speech. With the help of Archdruid [[Aina Lefaliir\|Aina Lefaliir]], he learned to harness and control the facets of nature around him, and even those within him, transforming himself into a true denizen of nature, growing claws, fur, and enhanced senses. This form allowed him to harness his father's inherited anger, as he trained to utilize it for the betterment of nature, rather than the punishment of the innocent.

He would never be like his father. He was better, and no matter what happened, he would free his mother from his clutches and defend the Enclave the best he could.
