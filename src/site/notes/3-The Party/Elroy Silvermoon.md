Elroy Silvermoon moved from Daggerford to Waterdeep, taking up residence in the [[5-World Almanac/Locations/Wards/Field Ward\|Field Ward]] and finding employment at a small local library known as The [[House of Song\|House of Song]]. The library, an old institution funded by [[Blackstaff Academy\|Blackstaff Academy]] and located in the [[Trade Ward\|Trade Ward]], was run by a Gnomish bookkeeper named [[Sabbit\|Sabbit]], who hired him and quickly became a close friend.

In time, he met [[Nala Ahmaergo\|Nala Ahmaergo]], and their relationship blossomed into marriage. Years later, they welcomed a child, [[Talma\|Talma]]. Living in a challenging neighborhood where safety came at a price, they reluctantly paid protection money to the local gang, the [[5-World Almanac/a_Antagonistic Factions/Xanathar's Thieves' Guild\|Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. He was well-known for his disdain for the guild, making it a shock when he discovered that Nala had begun undertaking jobs for them. His discovery came too late; the local government arrested him for tax evasion, presenting evidence falsely attributed to him. With the aid of a sympathetic City Watch officer, Constable [[Carrion Cromley\|Carrion Cromley]], enough investigation was conducted to reveal Nala's involvement, though she disappeared before any connection to the mob could be established. Although he was cleared of the charges and granted full custody of Talma, the guild retaliated by increasing his payments beyond his means to pay. One night, Talma was taken by the guild, who left a note written in her blood as a harrowing reminder of his growing debt.

In his desperation, he turned to the library's resources, searching for a way to gain the power to reclaim his daughter. There, hidden among the dusty shelves, he found an old book written entirely in Gnomish. With Sabbit's help, having taught him some Gnomish, he uncovered a hidden secret named the Song of Creation. Convinced that this was the key to solving his problems, he began his bardic studies, drawing upon his previous love for poetry and philosophy to harness this newfound knowledge.

His neighbors included [[Miss Spud\|Miss Spud]], an elderly goblin grandma known for her friendliness, and [[Biv\|Biv]], an old, lonely man who spoke very little. Despite his personal turmoil, the community around him provided small comforts in his quest to save his daughter and overcome the threats that loomed over his life.
